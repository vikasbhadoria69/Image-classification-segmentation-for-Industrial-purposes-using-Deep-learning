# Image classification & segmentation for Industrial purposes using Deep learning.
### Leveraged the power of Deep learning and build a model that can be used for classifying & detecting defects in industrial images.
* **Image Classification**: Used Transfer Learning technique and deploy Microsoft's ‘ResNet’ deep learning architecture on the dataset to classify which images are having defects and which are normal.
* **Image Segmentation**: Once the images with defects were classified with high accuracy the second step taken is to localize the defects. Pointed out where exactly the defects in an image are using ResUNet deep learning model.
3. Tested the model on the images which it has never seen before. By achieving a good accuracy on test data, the model can be deployed in real world industrial applications for classifying defective product images and segmenting the exact location of defect.
